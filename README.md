# Data Science Tools 1 Final Project
## Exploratory Data Analysis and Pattern Identification of Colorado Avalanches 
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on avalanche occurences recorded by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center as well as all recorded fatal avalanches in the United States and determine if there are any clear patterns in the data that will allow us to identify potentially dangerous situations.
