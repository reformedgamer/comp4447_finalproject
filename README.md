# Data Science Tools 1 Final Project
## Exploratory Data Analysis and Pattern Identification of Colorado Avalanches 
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on avalanche occurences recorded by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center as well as all recorded fatal avalanches in the United States and determine if there are any clear patterns in the data that will allow us to identify potentially dangerous situations. 
We will try to identify any patterns to determine if certain conditions, areas, or activities are more dangerous than others.
We will analyze two datasets:
- The primary dataset includes all observed avalanches from 2010 to present day in Colorado.
- The secondary dataset includes all recorded fatal avalanches from 1951 to present day across the entire United States.
